# Stock Research Evaluation
* **Quiz**: You are given information on a stock and submit whether you are bearish or bullish on the stock. You are awarded points if this matches analyst's opinions. 
* **Removal**: If the quiz was not able to find information on a stock, this will remove it from the stock list for the quiz.
* **Cleaner**: Jupyter Notebook which turns the raw HTML from which the stock list for the quiz was extracted into a clean list.

This project was built using python and tests the users ability to recognize the fate of stocks based on their fundamentals. There is more to a stock than its fundamentals, so success or failure is not necessarily predictive or your success as a stock picker. However, your average over many stocks *can* give you a better idea of your skill as a stock picker, and practicing with this can help you get better at noticing what factors tend to be important in a stock's predicted success.
